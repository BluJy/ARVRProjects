## ARVR Projects
Projects that have been created during my Virtual and Augmented Reality course.
In collaboration with https://github.com/Jasperouz.
- [x] Motion Guidance System
- [x] Food Monsters Marker Tracking



<!-- Motion Guidance System -->
## Motion Guidance System
The goal of our work is to investigate how the remembrance of a motion can be increased by adding assistive visualizations to a motion guidance system. 
Therefore, we designed and implemented a motion guidance system in VR and implemented two assistive visualizations which presumably increase the memorability of motions.

## Food Monsters Marker Tracking
First steps in Unity by creating working markers with Vuforia that can be tracked through the devices Camera.
It shows food monsers that can display different animations in Augmented Reality.
